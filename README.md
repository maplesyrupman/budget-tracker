# Xpense Tracker
A personal budget tracking PWA connected to a MongoDB instance. 

## Description
The purpose of this project was for me to solidify my understanding of PWAs and service workers. My focus on this project was creating service-worker.js and manifest.webmanifest, as well as deploying the application to Heroku and connecting it to MongoDB Atlas. 

## Getting Started
### Dependancies 
- compression v1.7.4
- express v4.17.1
- mongoose v5.5.15
- morgan v1.9.1
- nodemon v2.0.15 

### Technologies and Concepts
In this project, I developed and implemented a service worker in order to convert the application into a PWA, thus offering offline use.
